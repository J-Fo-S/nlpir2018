This is a simple toy MLP for sentiment analysis that I pretty much entirely took from https://github.com/hankcs/CS224n/tree/master/assignment1. All I did was convert to Python3 and add a line for the MLP classifier. The model only achieves around 40% accuracy (actually less) and seems to overfit when the regularization is high. As starting point, though, perhaps it is interesting. To run, simply execute the shell script to get the dataset, and run ```q4_sentiment_mlp.py --pretrained``` to use the pretrained data, or ```q4_sentiment_mlp.py --yourvectors``` if you have your own data.
